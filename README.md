# School Dashboard

This is a web based school dashboard my team submitted for our Information System course. We built this on PHP and it has some of these functions :
- CRUD functions
- 3 level access (Admin, Teacher, and Student)
- different login access for each level and landing page
- input form stored in SQL database
- cookie

~~One note though, I am bad at design so our interface look painfully bad.~~
